## About AstoriaCore

AstoriaCore is a customized Version of TrinityCore and the private source of WaloriaCore by Fractional aka Fred. With this project 
we want to bring **Classless** to a new level. With many extensions, *AstoriaCore* is different from all other TrinityCore branches.
*AstoriaCore* was the basis of the Classless Project "Project Astoria" which was managed by Lushen, Acidy and OMGhixD.
