## Requirements

AstoriaCore based on WaloriaCore is a quite old branch from TrinityCore back from 2015. That's the reason why you need very special Versions of your daily known compiling and Building Tools.
You can read up here what tools do you need to compile this Core for your Windows Machine. A Linux Doc is planned but not yet added and will still take time.

## Tools

* [Visual Studio 2015 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/older-downloads/)
* [CMake 3.18.6](https://cmake.org/download/)
* [GIT Extension](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [MySQL Server 5.7 Community Edition](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html)
* [OpenSSL 1.0.2u](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
