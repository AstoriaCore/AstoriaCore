### character_honor
> This is the Table for the Honor System, it is 100% required to have the Honor System working. Since the Honor System is a whole replacement for the old Honor System of Blizzlike TrinityCore 3.3.5a, you need to have this custom Table with the correct units. If you don't have it the Honor gain will be broken. You can find the SQL inside the SQL/Updates/characters folder.
